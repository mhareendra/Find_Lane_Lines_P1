**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of multiple steps.  
1. Validate size of image, resize if necessary
2. Convert image to grayscale
3. Apply Gaussian Blur with kernel size of 7x7
4. Perform Canny edge detection with low threshold = 120 and high threshold = 180
5. Extract the region of interest using a 4-sided polygon mask defined by vertices
6. Detect lane lines using hough transform

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:
